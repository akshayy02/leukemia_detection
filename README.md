# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection

## Introduction
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer affecting white blood cells. This project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, to classify white blood cell images into ALL-positive and ALL-negative categories. Early and accurate detection of leukemia can greatly enhance the treatment process and patient outcomes.

## Features
- Classifies white blood cell images into ALL-positive or ALL-negative.
- Implements two deep learning models: 
  - A basic **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
  - **ResNet-18**, a more advanced CNN architecture.
- High accuracy achieved using ResNet-18, making the model suitable for potential real-world applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - PyTorch 
  - TensorFlow and Keras 
  - Pandas, NumPy 
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn 
- **Tools:**
  - Kaggle (for dataset)
